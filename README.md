## Summary

Haiti holds the world's second-largest iridium deposits, as reported by *Orinoco Tribune* on January 2, 2025, authored by Graham G. Henry (originally published October 6, 2021). Located primarily in the Southeast Department, including Beloc and Bainet, these reserves—confirmed by South African experts in 2014 and recognized by Haiti’s Bureau of Mines and Energy—position Haiti as a potential economic powerhouse. Dr. Henry Vixamar, an economics professor, argues that exploiting these reserves, alongside oil and natural gas, could revive Haiti’s economy and create millions of jobs. Iridium, valued at $6,000 per ounce in March 2021 (three times gold’s price), is critical for industries like aerospace, electronics, and energy due to its rarity and resistance to heat and corrosion. This app visualizes Haiti’s resource reserves and projects their economic potential over 20 years, highlighting a path to prosperity through interactive maps and revenue forecasts.

## Installation

To run this Shiny app locally:

1. Ensure R is installed (version 4.0.0 or higher recommended).
2. Install required packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "leaflet", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", "DT", "tidyr", "scales"))
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/HaitiResourcePotential.git

4. Open `app.R` in RStudio and click "Run App" or use:
   ```R
   shiny::runApp("path/to/HaitiResourcePotential")
   ```

## Usage

- **Sidebar**: Adjust the year range (2025–2045) and select resources (Iridium, Oil, Gold, Natural Gas) to filter data.
- **Economic Projection Tab**: View a dynamic plot of projected revenue over time, with color-coded lines for each resource.
- **Resource Map Tab**: Explore a map of Haiti’s Southeast with markers sized by combined resource reserves, including popups with detailed reserve data.
- **Revenue Table**: See total projected revenue for the selected period and resources, formatted in USD.

## Why This Matters

Haiti’s iridium reserves, second only to South Africa’s, offer a rare economic opportunity. Valued at $6,000 per ounce in 2021—three times gold’s price—iridium’s applications in aircraft engines, deep-water pipelines, and 5G technology make it a critical resource. Combined with oil and gas reserves, its exploitation could, as Dr. Vixamar suggests, create millions of jobs and revitalize Haiti’s economy. This matters because Haiti, often plagued by economic challenges, could leverage these untapped resources to shift from aid dependency to self-sustained growth, impacting sectors from manufacturing to energy and improving living standards.

## Conclusion

This Shiny app demonstrates Haiti’s resource potential through interactive visualizations, drawing from credible data and expert insights. By mapping reserves in the Southeast and projecting revenue growth, it underscores the transformative power of iridium, oil, and gas for Haiti’s future. Future enhancements could include real-time market data and detailed economic models.
